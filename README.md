# Air quality usa vs india.
Comparative Analytics between teo country and theri states and cities.


Conclusion
India faces significantly more severe air quality challenges compared to the USA across all statistical measures. While both countries have regions with relatively clean air (minimum AQI values are comparable), India's overall pollution levels are substantially higher, with average, median, and maximum AQI values being 3-5 times worse than the USA. The concentration of extremely high AQI values in India's northern states (Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab) represents a critical public health concern that far exceeds any air quality issues observed in US states.
